## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Affero distribution of RStuduio.  The code should run with no issues using RStudio versions 3.6.2.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using the 3 differnt feature noise-robust clustering methods to better understand:

1. Which one works best with high-Dimension data?
2. Which one works best with more-noise data?
3. Which one works best with high-correlation data?
4. Which one works best with data having different number of true lable?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is a R file (including entire code) available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  The R file is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://github.com/QianM2020/Benchmarking-in-Clustering-K-Medoids-Student-T-Model-and-DBSCAN/blob/main/Clustering%20Benchmark-%20K%20Medoids%2C%20Student%20T%20Model%20and%20DBSCAN.pdf).

You can find the code for simulateing the data in R file here.
Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
